# Prosper-Loan-Data-Analysis
Use of many visualization techniques to explore Prosper Loan Dataset dataset, polish key plots to tell a story.
## Dataset
The data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. I investigated the interactions of LoanStatus, CreditScoreRange, LoanOriginalAmounts with BorrowerAPR as an indicator of Loan favorbility, using a combination of numerical and qualitatie analysis.
## Summary of Findings
From the analysis, here are my findings:
* Most borrowers preferred a loan Term of 36 months
* 79% of Borrowers were Employed, with 62% of Loans requested for Debt Consolidation.
* People with income range of $25,000-49,999 are the ones who are taking loans most
* California (CA), Texas (TX) and New York (NY) have the 3 biggest numbers of loans originated in that period of time.
* Most borrowers get Prosper Rating of 'C'
* There was a drop in 2009 in loans but it started to increase gradually and reached it's peak at 2013
## Key Insights for Presentation
From the exploratory analysis of BorrowerAPR vs LoanStatus graph i noticed that Current and completed loans have lower rate than the past-due loans and have lower mean. On Borrower APR vs Employment status graph i noticed that Employed people have lower IQR than non-employed people. Also, past due loans generally have higher interest rates in all employment statuses. Most of the loans with higher amounts (>$20,000) are taken by people with higher prosper score
